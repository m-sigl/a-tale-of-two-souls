  <h1>2013 – Postcards and Positions</h1>
  <h2>They travel light. Except for secrets. Those they carry everywhere.</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <p>
      To the world, they were just another retired couple chasing adventure.  
      Blog updates. Smiling selfies. Postcards stamped from Athens, Kyoto, Tulum.
    </p>

    <p>
      But behind the filters was something else. In the hotel rooms. On the trains. On rooftops they weren’t supposed to be on.  
      They touched like newlyweds. Fucked like myth. Whispered names they only used abroad.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>
      They weren’t hiding. They were **protecting** it — what they’d found. Not just love, but play. Not just intimacy, but ritual. A private religion made of moans, museums, and midnight check-ins.
    </p>

    <p>
      People said they were “goals.”  
      They just smiled. And booked the next flight.
