  <h1>1520 – The Feather and the Blade</h1>
  <h2>A fleeting alliance. A dance between destroyer and dreamer.</h2>

  <div class="section">

      He arrived with iron. With horses. With language wrapped in conquest and a cross. His blade shone brighter than the sunstones. She stood among the ruins of gods, feathers draped over her shoulders like wind-stilled wings.
    </p>

    <p>
      They should have been enemies. But in the jungle night, when drums ceased and maps were useless, she showed him the sky not as a thing to name, but to surrender to.
    </p>

      He gave her a mirror. She gave him a mask. Both gifts told lies. Both gifts told truths.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>
