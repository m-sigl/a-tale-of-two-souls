  <h1>1918 – War and Glory</h1>
  <h2>Some souls never meet in peace. Only on the battlefield.</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <p><strong>Setting:</strong> Western Front, final year of World War I.</p>
    <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 1900–1940</p>
    <p><strong>Connection:</strong> In a trench soaked in mud and grief, they find each other. One bandages wounds by candlelight. The other dreams of home. Glory is a lie, but the way they held hands before dawn—that was real.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <p>He was nineteen and already hollowed by smoke. She was in disguise, or maybe just forgotten by the gods. They shared no medals. No photos. Only a scrap of paper folded into a locket, lost in the mud with a name smeared by rain.</p>

    <p>They met again in 1939, not knowing what they were remembering. But the ache told them. They would not survive the second war either. But they would go down with music in their bones and love carved beneath their ribs.</p>
