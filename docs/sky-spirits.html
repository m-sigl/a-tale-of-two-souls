  <h1>1851 – Sky Spirits</h1>
  <h2>One prays to ancestors. The other paints them.</h2>

  <div class="section">

      She knelt beneath the cottonwood, her palms pressed to the soil. The wind moved through her braids like a whisper of those who had come before. Her voice did not rise — it resonated.
    </p>

    <p>
      He came with brushes. A book of watercolors. A commission from a museum back East. But when he saw her, he stopped sketching feathers and beads. He began painting her silence. Her stillness.
    </p>

    <p>
      She knew he watched. She let him. Not because she trusted him, but because something in his gaze felt like memory — misremembered, but longing to be corrected.
    </p>

    <p>
      One evening, she approached and placed a single red ochre handprint on the canvas. Not approval. Not dismissal. Just presence.
    </p>

    <p>
      He asked if he could paint her. She said only if he prayed first. Not with words — with breath, with stillness, with humility. He did.
    </p>

    <p>
      When he left, the portrait remained unfinished. A smudge of color where her eyes would have been. She kept it beneath her blanket, beside the bones of her ancestors. Not hidden. Just waiting.
