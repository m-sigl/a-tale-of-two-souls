  <h1>1953 – Neon and Rust</h1>
  <h2>A diner booth. Jazz on vinyl. Glances that could burn.</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <p>
      The bell above the door jingled like a warning. He slid into her booth like he’d been doing it his whole life — but tonight was the first time. Her cigarette was already burning. His coffee was already poured.
    </p>

    <p>
      They didn’t know each other. That’s what they said, anyway. But the waitress gave them that look — the one reserved for affairs and small-town sins. He tapped the jukebox without looking. “Kind of Blue” started playing. She smirked like he’d passed a test.
    </p>

    <p>
      She wore red gloves she never took off. He had grease under his nails, from a car that didn’t belong to him. Outside, rain kissed chrome and oil slicks. Inside, the heat between them made the sugar packets sweat.
    </p>

    <p>
      They talked like strangers. They listened like lovers. He asked where she was headed. She said, “Away from here. You coming?”
    </p>

    <p>
      They didn’t kiss. Not then. They paid in change. They left in silence. But the air around them glowed — like a sign left on long after closing.
    </p>

    <p>
      No one remembers what happened to either of them. But there’s a rumor in that town: if you sit at that booth after midnight and put on track 4... the other one just might show up.
    </p>
