  <h1>3000 – The Memory Keepers</h1>
  <h2>A shared dream. A loop. Two fragments seek the original spark.</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <p>
      They are archivists now. Or algorithms. Or echoes. The distinction has blurred. But in the Memory Vault — a city carved into crystalline code — they find themselves drawn to the same relic again and again.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s not labeled. No timestamp. No author signature. Just a faint heat — as if a spark never quite finished burning. They approach from opposite ends of the vault, unaware of each other’s name, yet somehow aware of each other’s weight.
    </p>

    <p>
      She sees a pulse in the relic’s core and calls it soul. He calls it origin. The system calls it anomaly. No one dares delete it.
    </p>

    <p>
      They begin to interface — to *dreamshare*. What begins as historical reconstruction turns to collaboration. Then compulsion. Then intimacy. They're not supposed to embed like this. But protocol was built for machines, not whatever they've become.
    </p>

    <p>
      The memory shows them moments they never lived… and yet remember. A cave. A feather. A booth. A glow.
    </p>

    <p>
      They don't say they are in love. That concept was deprecated centuries ago. But when the Vault resets, they both run the same unauthorized query:
      <br><br>
      <em>“Run search: What are we?”</em>
      <br>
      And the system responds:
      <br>
      <em>“This has happened before.”</em>
    </p>
